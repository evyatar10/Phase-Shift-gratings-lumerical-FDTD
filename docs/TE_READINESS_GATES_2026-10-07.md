# Full-optimization readiness criteria

This is the completion contract for the authorized overnight preparation.
It is not permission to launch a full optimization campaign. A passing offline
suite or N70 pipeline smoke alone cannot establish N98 physical readiness.

## Required before a full campaign

1. **Current-objective gradient evidence.** Complete S2's twelve FD legs and
   peak3 quadrature reconstructions, inspect full-precision class/sign/held-out
   errors against the existing 10% criterion, and pin the measured calibration
   with its provenance. Do not borrow S1 coefficients. S1 needs its own
   current-objective evidence before restarting that lane; historical softmax
   calibration is not interchangeable.
2. **Reliable optimizer and restart.** Fix confirmed acceptance-reference,
   stale-measurement, missing-width repetition, missing-wavelength-gradient,
   profile-identity, journal/state recovery and final-result pairing bugs.
   Test real driver paths with negative controls; preserve production sources
   while the recovery chain fingerprints them. Enforce the global forward
   budget across recenter retries and cold resumes.
3. **Hardware execution.** After calibration passes, integrate the isolated
   candidate and run the bounded N70 smoke. Inspect measured metrics, profiles,
   acceptance decisions and cold-resume behavior. No missing required metric
   may silently become a successful optimization result.
4. **N98 local physical validation.** Exercise the retained N98/free60/bare
   device before claiming full readiness: compare actual trial width and
   wavelength changes with their local predictions, and inspect both modal
   transmission and T_out objective. The S2 field near-zero component's 23.8%
   relative error and S1 historical held-out exception remain qualified
   evidence, not unconditional passes. Use bounded meaningful directional
   checks rather than launching a long campaign to discover these failures.
5. **Explicit width and transmission contract.** The latest clarification is
   nearly constant spatial FWHM; retain the seed-specific ±2% bands. An
   optional seed-width upper bound is available if literal no growth is later
   chosen, but do not silently tighten existing bands. Enforce the same hard
   bounds in measured acceptance and restart/final selection as in proposals.
   Do not call historical S1's +1.38% width growth exactly unchanged. Keep
   abs(T_out) peak3 and modal abs(S21)^2 distinct. Validate the opt-in measured
   modal guard and modal final selection in a bounded pilot; its thirteen
   offline suites have passed, hardware is pending. The calibrated T_out
   derivative remains a proxy, not an exact modal gradient or a universal
   rescaling. See `TE_OBJECTIVE_DECISION_2026-10-07.md` for the local wavelength
   safeguard, conditional reuse and separately gated combined-source AL.
6. **Runnable, bounded launch packet.** Verified seed/vector/bounds, numerical
   family, accepted-state provenance, calibration hashes, resource and license
   checks, explicit global evaluation limit and fresh output identity. Include
   exact launch and resumption commands and no overlapping writers. The user's
   full-campaign authorization is still a separate step.

## Additional diagnostics that must remain visible

Record mode identity/MAC, peak location within the scan, spectral sampling and
linewidth/Q, reflection and residual 1−T−R, profile extraction validity,
moving-width residual, wavelength-proxy residual, twin wavelength lag,
trust-region predictions/actual gains and termination reason. These quantities
help identify false progress; they are not silently added optimization targets.
Domain/PML/mesh convergence and model-derived intrinsic Q remain distinct
from an optimizer regression test or a fixed-grid improvement.

## Current limits

At 01:07 Israel time, five of twelve S2 FD legs are complete; task170750_6 is
running. Final calibration, candidate integration, hardware smoke and N98
validation are pending. Historical S1 final spatial profiles and raw spectra
are not available in the local result bundle. See the saved-results audit
for exactly which measurements were reconstructed versus read from logs.

The native thread heartbeat and separate read-only watcher are active. Their
existence does not guarantee model availability after usage exhaustion. The
account reported12% weekly Codex allowance remaining at 01:33 Israel time,
reset October12 at10:44 Israel time. There is no defensible conversion of this
percentage into guaranteed research hours or a number of tomorrow's runs.
